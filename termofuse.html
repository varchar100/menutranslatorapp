    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Menu Translator is a mobile application that uses optical character recognition (OCR) and artificial intelligence to translate restaurant menus from images captured by your device's camera. The App provides translations, ingredient information, and allergen warnings for menu items.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Ensuring you have permission to photograph menus in restaurants</li>
      <li>Not using the App for any illegal or unauthorized purposes</li>
      <li>Respecting the intellectual property rights of restaurants and menu creators</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Translation Accuracy</h2>
    <p>While we strive to provide accurate translations and information, Menu Translator cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of translations or ingredient information. Always verify with restaurant staff if you have allergies or dietary restrictions.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Do not rely solely on the App for allergen information. Always consult with restaurant staff about ingredients and allergens before ordering.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses Google's Gemini API for image processing and translation services. Your use of these services is also subject to Google's Terms of Service. We are not responsible for any third-party service failures or changes.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Menu Translator and are protected by international copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall Menu Translator be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising out of your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>9. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App requires camera permission to function properly. By granting these permissions, you acknowledge that the App will access your device's camera solely for the purpose of scanning restaurant menus.</p>

    <h2>10. Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <p>You may not use the App to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violate any laws or regulations</li>
      <li>Infringe on the rights of others</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse engineer or hack the App</li>
      <li>Use the App for commercial purposes without permission</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice, if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the App will cease immediately.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitute acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
